          Diabetes is a chronic disease on the rise globally, including in
          Indonesia, with a prevalence of 10.8% in 2021 (International Diabetes
          Federation). This condition, especially type 2 diabetes (T2D), poses
          serious risks such as heart attacks, kidney failure, and vision loss.
          Unfortunately, half of T2D cases remain undiagnosed, limiting access
          to necessary care and increasing the risk of severe complications.
          <br /><br />
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution by analyzing
          data to detect patterns associated with diabetes. By leveraging
          algorithms, AI can predict the likelihood of diabetes, aiding early
          diagnosis and timely medical intervention. Through AI, the detection
          and management of diabetes can become more efficient, improving
          patient outcomes.
